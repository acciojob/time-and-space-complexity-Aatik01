	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It is a crucial metric in evaluating how efficient an algorithm is.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <code>O(n)</code> uses memory proportional to the input size.
